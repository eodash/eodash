### Benchmarks

Previous run → this run. Baseline [`2f0b70e56f38a670ef02544ad2d2d8edcc9c5843`](https://github.com/eodash/eodash/commit/2f0b70e56f38a670ef02544ad2d2d8edcc9c5843), 2026-10-07T13:20:15.990Z.

- date snap: moving the date rebuilds all six collections' layers
- layer datetime: changing one layer's date replaces only that layer
- explore item: selecting a catalog item renders its layer
- links=1, links=10, links=100: scales with the number of layers a collection contributes
- geozarr bands: dragging a band rebuilds the source
- poi selection: selecting a POI indicator builds the observation points layer
- select indicator: loads a multi-collection indicator and its widgets
- vector rendering, geotiff rendering: draws a styled layer of each source type
- mosaic scrub: scrubbing the time range rebuilds the mosaic layer
- mirrored selection: selecting a mirrored indicator decodes its items and builds a layer

| requests | requests the application issued through its HTTP client per run; the tests resolve them from fixtures (`mocked`), so nothing is transferred |
| fetches | requests the browser issued over the network per run: tiles, data files, anything the tests do not intercept |
| bytes | encoded body size of the responses; 0 where the origin sends no `timing-allow-origin` header |
| status | `mocked` where the tests resolved the request; HTTP codes where the browser fetched it; both where the application did both |
