## Developer Experience
Eodash prioritizes a smooth developer experience by incorporating these key elements:

* [Vite Powered](https://vite.dev): The Eodash CLI leverages Vite to streamline the development process and enable the seamless creation of both applications and web component libraries.

* [Vue-Based](https://vue.org): The Eodash client is built on Vue 3, offering flexibility for users to create custom internal widgets and construct their dashboards as either Single Page Applications (SPAs) or reusable web components.

* [EOxElements Integration](https://eox-a.github.io/EOxElements/?path=/docs/about--docs): Eodash widgets draw their power from EOxElements, providing a robust foundation for visualization components.

* [Typescript Support](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): Although Eodash uses JSDOC internally, it includes native Typescript support and exports its type definitions, enhancing code maintainability and reducing potential errors.
